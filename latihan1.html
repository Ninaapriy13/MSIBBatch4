		Hello everyone, my name is Nina Apriyanti. You guys can call me Nina or whatever. To be honest, I'm confused about what to say about me because there really isn't anything interesting about me or maybe I don't really like writing hahaha. Fine, let's start from the beginning, yes my origin part is in this world. I was born and grew up in Cirebon. Wait... actually not entirely in Cirebon because for some years I live in Kalimantan, the city of Pontianak to be precise. If you ask why I live there, it's because of my father, yes he is a policeman. For some reason I love living in Cirebon. And now I'm studying at the Gunung Jati Swadaya University, Cirebon city. See....how much I love this city? But the reality is not like that, more precisely because I am the youngest child, that's why my parents are very possessive. But I'm so grateful to have them in my life. And... if I may tell you about my free time, I actually have almost no free time, why? because most of the time I focus on my studies and the many organizational activities on campus and off-campus organizations that I participate in. Didn't mean to look busy like others hahaha. Apart from that, I am also busy with my work as a COO (Chief Operating Officer) at a Sending Organization company for workers to Japan and Netherland. I know it doesn't look like a real free person. But whatever it is, my principle is "just live your life as best as you can, enjoy the process, let God reward you for everything you've done".

		Ok, now I will tell you why I was able to join this program "MSIB Batch 4" at PT. Nurul Fikri Cipta Inovasi? I know this might seem unreasonable, yes maybe because I'm majoring in Management. However, I took this Web Developer as one of my reasons, because as an "economic person" I am well aware that developments in the business world continue to progress as technology develops in the current era of globalization, so I thought...what's the point of having the knowledge if we don't able to create a "container" for us to implement our knowledge. That's the reason why I took this Web Developer program. And so far I'm enjoying it, especially with very good friends and mentors. Thank you all for accepting me so well. Oh yeah...before participating in this MSIB program, I also previously participated in other Kampus Merdeka programs. I have participated in the student exchange program at Universitas Negeri Makassar from 2021 to 2022. Then I also passed the PKM (Program Kreatifitas Mahasiswa) program organized by KEMDIKBUDRISTEK in 2022 with my research namely "Persepsi dan Partisipasi Komunitas Pemuda Hijrah terhadap Nikah Muda". Yes, maybe that's all I can share with you. Thank you for your attention.
